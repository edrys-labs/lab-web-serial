        Welcome to your first steps in Python and MicroPython! This tutorial is
        designed to ease you into the world of programming through interactive
        code examples and detailed explanations. Let's start by exploring the core
        elements of Python programming.

        ### Module 1: Python Basics


        **Objective:**


        Familiarize students with Python syntax and basic programming concepts.

        #### Step 1: Hello, Python!

        1. **Your First Python Program**

          - Type the following code into the provided online code editor and run it:

            ```python
            print("Hello, world!")
            ```

          - This code will display the text "Hello, world!" on your screen.

        #### Step 2: Variables and Data Types

        1. **Working with Variables**

          - Learn how to create and use variables:

            ```python
            my_number = 10
            my_string = "Python is fun!"
            print(my_number, my_string)
            ```

        2. **Different Data Types**

          - Introduce integers, strings, floats, and booleans through examples:

            ```python
            age = 12  # An integer
            temperature = 25.5  # A float
            is_sunny = True  # A boolean
            ```

        #### Step 3: Basic Operations

        1. **Mathematical Operations**

          - Perform basic arithmetic operations:

            ```python
            # Addition
            print(10 + 5)
            # Subtraction
            print(10 - 5)
            # Multiplication
            print(10 * 5)
            # Division
            print(10 / 5)
            ```

        2. **String Operations**

          - Concatenate and manipulate strings:

            ```python
            first_name = "Ada"
            last_name = "Lovelace"
            full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
            print("Hello, " + full_name)
            ```

        #### Step 4: Control Structures

        1. **If Statements**

          - Make decisions using if, elif, and else:

            ```python
            if age > 18:
                print("You are an adult.")
            elif age > 12:
                print("You are a teenager.")
            else:
                print("You are a child.")
            ```

        2. **Loops**

          - Learn to use for and while loops to repeat tasks:

            ```python
            # Using a for loop to count to five
            for i in range(1, 6):
                print(i)

            # Using a while loop to count to five
            count = 1
            while count <= 5:
                print(count)
                count += 1
            ```

        ### Conclusion:

        Congratulations on completing the basics of Python! You've learned how to
        write simple scripts, use variables, perform operations, and control the
        flow of your programs. These skills are the building blocks for diving
        into MicroPython and starting to program the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense.


        **Next Steps:**


        - Move on to applying these Python fundamentals in MicroPython.

        - Start simple projects on the Arduino to see these concepts in action
        with physical computing.


        ## Part II: MicroPython Fundamentals and Blink Example

        **Tutorial Overview:**


        Building on the Python basics, this extension of the tutorial delves into
        MicroPython specifics and demonstrates how to apply Python fundamentals to
        control hardware. The focus will be on understanding MicroPython's
        additional features and differences, leading to a hands-on project that
        controls an LED on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense.

        **Objective:**


        Introduce MicroPython, explain its differences and additional features
        compared to standard Python, and guide students through creating a simple
        hardware control project.

        ### Module 2: Introduction to MicroPython


        ### Step 1: What is MicroPython?


        1. **Overview of MicroPython**


          - MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of Python designed to run on microcontrollers.

          - It includes modules to interact directly with hardware, such as GPIOs (general-purpose input/output), PWM (pulse-width modulation), ADC (analog to digital converters), and more.

        ### Step 2: MicroPython vs. Python

        1. **Differences Explained**


          - Discuss how MicroPython is optimized for microcontrollers with limited processing power and memory.

          - Highlight specific modules and functions in MicroPython that are not found in standard Python, like `machine` for controlling hardware.

        ### Module 3: Your First MicroPython Project – Blinking an LED

        ### Step 3: Basic MicroPython Syntax and GPIO Control

        1. **Control Structures and Syntax**

          - Review similar syntax as Python for control structures like if statements and loops, emphasizing syntax differences if any.

        2. **Introduction to `machine` Module**

          - Explain the `machine` module used for accessing the GPIO:

            ```python
            from machine import Pin
            ```

        ### Step 4: Writing the Blink Code

        1. **Setting Up the LED**

          - Show how to define a pin as an output:

            ```python
            led = Pin(13, Pin.OUT)  # Pin 13 is typically the onboard LED for many Arduino boards
            ```

        2. **Creating a Blink Function**

          - Write a function to turn the LED on and off:

            ```python
            import time

            def blink(led, duration):
                led.value(1)  # Turn LED on
                time.sleep(duration)  # Keep it on for 'duration' seconds
                led.value(0)  # Turn LED off
                time.sleep(duration)  # Keep it off for 'duration' seconds
            ```

        3. **Running the Blink Function**

          - Use a loop to continuously call the blink function:

            ```python
            while True:
                blink(led, 0.5)  # Blink every 0.5 seconds
            ```

        ### Step 5: Detailed Explanation of the Blink Code

        1. **Explaining Each Line**

          - `from machine import Pin`: Imports the Pin class for controlling GPIO pins.

          - `import time`: Imports the time module to use the sleep function.

          - `led = Pin(13, Pin.OUT)`: Sets up pin 13 as an output pin connected to the LED.

          - `def blink(led, duration)`: Defines a function named blink that takes two arguments, `led` (the LED pin) and `duration` (time the LED stays on or off).

          - `led.value(1)` and `led.value(0)`: These lines turn the LED on and off, respectively.
            `1` sets the pin high, and `0` sets it low.

          - `time.sleep(duration)`: Pauses the program for the number of seconds specified by `duration`.

        ### Conclusion:

        Congratulations! You have successfully programmed your Arduino Nano 33 BLE
        Sense with MicroPython to blink an LED. This project illustrates how you
        can control physical hardware using the programming skills you've
        developed.


        **Next Steps:**

        - Experiment with modifying the blink rate and combining other sensors or
        outputs.

        - Try adding more LEDs or create patterns with multiple outputs.
